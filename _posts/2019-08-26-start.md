This blog is built using [Gihub pages](https://pages.github.com/) + [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)!

There are many open-source jekyll theme you can choose, but I chose this theme [jekyll-theme-prologue](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue),
because its structure really fits my needs, and it's really easy to get started!

I improved some UI settings to make it more readable, and made some customized layouts for the portfolio page.

Future todo list

- more customization on the navigation bar
- ui adjustment on blog posts.
- show github language stat by lines (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8713596/how-to-retrieve-the-list-of-all-github-repositories-of-a-person)
