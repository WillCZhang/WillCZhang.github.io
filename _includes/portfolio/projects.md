## SSC Master &nbsp; [![GitHub Repository]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/github.png)](https://github.com/WillCZhang/SSC_Master)

# Key words: Android | Full-Stack | MongoDB | Web Crawler | Parser | Algorithms | Multithreading

- Implemented an Android application using Java including both material UI design and backend system.
- Implemented a full-stack web version of it using Node.js and MongoDB as backend and jQuery frontend.
- Crawled and parsed courses data from more than 18000 websites on UBC Student Service Centre (SSC).
- Designed an algorithm storing all the data in local cache files and, using an index file, mapping them with
  the user inputs in the search bar, in such way, only required data were added to the application.
- Used multiple threads process in Android and asynchronous in Node.js to speed up the process.


## 2048 Game &nbsp; [![GitHub Repository]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/github.png)](https://github.com/WillCZhang/2048)

# Keywords: Java Swing | Algorithms | Data Abstraction

- Built a 2048 game from scratch and designed an algorithm to handle each move user made
- Designed data structures and algorithms to handle frontend events


## Daily Planner &nbsp; [![GitHub Repository]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/github.png)](https://github.com/WillCZhang/DailyPlanner)

# Keywords: React-Redux | Meteor | Full-Stack | Scalable Server | Database Design | Algorithms

- Designed an algorithm to estimate the commute time between two geolocations, achieved 95% accuracy.
- Implemented a scalable backend so that API calls were minimized and not affected by the number of requests.
- Implemented a web frontend with page routing using React, AntDesign, and Redux.
- Designed the core structure that connects users and their preferences into an analyzable way for applying
  machine learning models in the future.


## Credit Card Late Payment Prediction

# Keywords: Supervised Machine Learning | Python

- Estimated whether a person will fail to pay their credit card bills using variety of machine learning models
(e.g. Logistic Regression model with L1/L2 regularization, Random Forest model, SVM, Neural Network
model, etc.) and several feature selection methods (e.g. feature scaling, change of basis, etc.) and
eventually achieved 0.17 error rate in predicting test dataset
- Rendered all the results (including graphs and tables) in Jupiter using Python


## Smart Hospital Management Web App

# Keywords: Full-Stack Development | JavaScript | PostgreSQL Database

- Implemented a Node.js server backend that handles each request sent from the frontend and write
queries to communicate with the PostgreSQL database
- Wrote JavaScript on the frontend to render the data sent back from the server using tables and graphs


## Insight UBC Web Application

# Keywords: Domain Specific Language Design | Database Management | Library Functions Implementation | Testing

- Implemented a RESTful web server using TypeScript as a backend and Bootstrap designed a front-end
- Wrote a query language interpreter that performs valid query requests for the POST method
- Used recursive function calls to rewrite TypeScript library functions like Document.getElementById()
- Parsed data from both JSON files and HTML files and managing them in a local database
- Handled all the possible exception cases, returned specific error messages and error codes as RESTful
endpoints, and tested the whole project using Mocha achieved 97% of the overall test line coverage


## Image Compression C++ Assignment

# Keywords: Pointer | Image Compressing | Image Transformation

- Implemented an image representation using pointers that built up a tree to store each pixel
- Wrote an image compression algorithm that blurred the pixels with similar RGB values to an average value
- Performed transformation functions on the image representation
